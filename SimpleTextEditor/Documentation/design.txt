Simple Text Editor
------------------

Design Goals:

	- WPF based control
	- Reasonable performance for large documents (requires virtual rendering, and tree-based text store)
	- User specified segmentation of documents (highlighted text, designated read-only sections)
	- Text folding based on segment tokens
	- Syntax Highlighting
	- Text Completion
	- Memory Considerations
	- Line Numbers
	- Customizable Margin: Debug markers, or other UI markers that are customizable

Microsoft TextFormatting:

	MSFT TextFormatter is used to format a line of text and measure its visual layout information. The 
	TextRun classes: (abstract) TextRun; TextCharacters; TextEndOfParagraph; TextEmbeddedObject; etc...
	all have properties that are used by the formatter; and may be of use for our design goals. 

		Possible Features:  Nested UI elements in text, collapsable statements (not just folding), word
							ellipses, etc...

							Also, each TextRun may have its own UI properties: TextRunProperties, which
							are used by the formatter on the backend.

	The rendering performance may depend on how few, or how many, individual TextRun objects are formatted
	during the render pass - or how much memory is consumed in the process of rendering. The task of
	rendering, from our perspective, is very simple from a MSFT integration standpoint. We just fill out
	the TextRun objects, pass them to the formatter, and render them as geometries using the DrawingContext.

	The MSFT TextSource object will be passed to the formatter - which we will inherit and extend - to
	meet our design goals, for the UI, for text formatting.

Text Source Performance:

	The text source will be indexed for most cases - except insertion. Avalon Edit has code for what may
	be known as a "Rope" - which is a binary tree for text. We'll commendere their code and clean it up to
	meet our code quality constraints! ^_^
